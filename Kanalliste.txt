7cloud music

7cloud music is a sensation somewhat like shivering, usually caused by music or other stimuli. 7cloud music is of short duration, usually no more than 4–5 seconds, usually pleasurable. For a long time, I have lived sometimes feeling a frisson, without even realizing that this phenomenon has a name. And now I'm trying to find and give you guys music that could cause such feelings.
